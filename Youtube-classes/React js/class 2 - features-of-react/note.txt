1.What is virtual DOM.
Ans: In order to learn virtual Dom , you have to know about DOM First.


Q1.What is DOM.
       HTML 
        |
    <p>Welcome</p>
        |
    Bytes 0011101
        |
      Chars <
            p
            >
        |
      Token (Tag) <a></a>
        |
      Node(Element) anchor
        |
      Parent
        |               ----> DOM ---> Layout ---> Render
    -------------
    child   child 

Markup -> Bytes -> Chars -> Token -> Node -> Dom -> Layout -> Render -> Paint

Thats mean what ever you write in HTML
                                 -----
that will translate into bytes.
The byte are translate into characters.
Characters are grouped and formed into Token.
Token are translate into nodes.
Nodes are ampended into Hierarchy order 
That Hierarchy order is known as DOM(documentobject model)
After this DOM is convert into layout. 
A layout decided which content where to be place.
Thats mean headers go on top footer goes into last 
and section goes into center
This layout under goes a process known as Rendering.
Render is the process of generated output.
Thats mean final output is ready to present into browers 
This presented into browers is known as painting.
This is the final stage happned.
and the result of paiting you will see on browser as welcome on the browser.


Note: Hierarchy presention is known as DOM
HTML present the dom 
javascript manipulate the dom 
in the simple word html present the button and javascript make 
that button working 
HTML is static dom and js make that dynamic




<style>
p{
    color: red;         ---> that is manage by CSSOM
}
</style>

<p>Welcome</p>          ----> that is manage by DOM





Q2. What is shadow DOM?
Ans: It is an hierarchy configured for every component in HTML.  
- Shadow DOM comprises of 
    a) Markup       <html></html>
    b) Styles       CSS
    c) Logic        JavaScript


Q3. What is Virtual DOM?
-It is a copy of actual DOM in memory.
-Update are first appended into virtual DOM and then into actual DOM.
-Faster in rendering output.
